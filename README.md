# riscos-sprite-js

Javascript library for reading RISC OS [Sprite][sprite-documentation] files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/RichardBrown384/riscos-sprite-js.git
```

## Project status

Support for 4-bpp and 8-bpp sprites should be relatively complete.
However, the library supports a limited subset of the available screen modes.
There isn't much in the way of good development practices such as testing, and the library is offered as is.
